module-7-terrains-Brutus314 created by GitHub Classroom

This module is very similar to the Physics module, mostly due to my lack
of time commitment to this project (sorry D=). The controls are the same there,
except for the lack of a pseudo physics module to go along with this. Press 1
to bring the location of the drop sphere to your current position, and press 2
to drop a cube from that location. The terrain is reduced in size by 10x in all
dimensions to increase speed and to reduce the chance of getting lost. Sorry for
the lack of effort here, it took awhile getting the terrain to show up at all and
the due date for this had passed, so this is what I've got.

Note that the woodland.bmp file was too large for GitHub's recommended maximum size.
Ideally, it should be included, but the module will work without it (albeit without textures).
